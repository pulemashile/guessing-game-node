## Node.js Card Guessing Game:
### Design and implement a card guessing game.

#### Objective:
    * The objective of this project is to create a card guessing game using Node.js.
        Users should be able to select two cards at a time, if they match they remain open, 
        if they donâ€™t match they flip to hide their contents again. 
        The game is won when all cards are successfully matched to their corresponding cards.

#### Interface:
    * Design a user-friendly interface that is intuitive for the game
    * Include a total of 36 cards: 6 rows and 6 columns. This will bring the matching set to 18
    * When the game starts, the cards should be set dynamically and remain in their selected positions until the game ends or is restarted by the user

#### Features:
    * When the page is opened, automatically set the cards and hide their contents.
    * Users can reset the game whenever they choose, changing the position of the cards
    * When the user wins, display a pop up to congratulate the user on winning.

#### Persistence:
    * No data is persisted

#### Testing:
    * Test the application thoroughly to ensure that all features work as expected
